# **Report on False Position Method**

## **Problem Statement**

In this report, we apply the **False Position Method (Regula Falsi Method)** to find the root of the nonlinear equation:

$$
f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5
$$

The equation cannot be solved directly using simple algebraic methods. The False Position Method, which is based on the principle of bracketing and linear interpolation, is used to approximate the solution.

## **False Position Method**

The False Position Method is a **bracketing method** for finding roots of a nonlinear function. It requires two initial guesses $a$ and $b$ such that:

$$
f(a) \cdot f(b) < 0
$$

This condition ensures that the root lies between $a$ and $b$.

The formula for the next approximation is:

$$
x = \frac{a \cdot f(b) - b \cdot f(a)}{f(b) - f(a)}
$$

The iteration continues until either:

1. $f(x)$ is very close to zero, or
2. The maximum number of iterations is reached.
